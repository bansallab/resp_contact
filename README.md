# Data and code for "Characterizing US contact patterns relevant to respiratory transmission from a pandemic to baseline: Analysis of a large cross-sectional survey"

This repository provides the data and source code for the following study: Juliana C Taube, Zachary Susswein, Vittoria Colizza, Shweta Bansal. "Characterizing US contact patterns relevant to respiratory transmission from a pandemic to baseline: Analysis of a large cross-sectional survey." https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.26.24306450

## Estimates
Pandemic and baseline estimates of contact at the county-week scale are provided. Estimates are also provided dis-aggregated by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and setting of contact.

Columns of interest:
- `contact_fit` has modeled pandemic estimates of mean contact
- `non_hh_contacts` has observed pandemic mean contact
- `scale_baseline` has inferred baseline estimates of mean contact
